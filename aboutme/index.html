    <h2>Guinho</h2>
<p>Hey ya'll! My name is Thiago Gomes Gouveia, I am from Brazil but I've been in the U.S for the past 6 years, currently living in California!</p>
<p>I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ in the Utah Salt Lake City Mission. 
One of my favorite thing to do in my free time is to draw, play music, skate, or to read a good book(including coming books and mangas)!</p>
